# Phase 10 — API Pen-Test Runbook

## Scope

Perform quarterly security testing of API endpoints in staging using OWASP ZAP (baseline) or equivalent.

## Targets

- /api/campaigns
- /api/pledges
- /api/vouches
- /api/disputes
- /api/evidence
- /api/sessions

## Preconditions

- Use staging environment only.
- Create a test wallet and seed funds on testnet.

## Tests

- Auth bypass attempts (missing/invalid SIWE)
- Rate limit abuse
- Payload fuzzing (JSON schema violations)
- File upload abuse (evidence)
- SSRF checks on any URL inputs

## Outputs

- Export HTML report from ZAP
- Create a ticket for every high/critical finding

## Acceptance Criteria

- Zero critical findings.
- Medium findings have tracked remediation tickets.
